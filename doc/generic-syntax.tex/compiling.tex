\chapter{Generic Compiler Passes and Compiler Passes as Semantics}

In the previous chapter we have seen various generic semantics one may be
interested in when working on a deeply embedded language: renaming,
substitution, printing with names or evaluation. All of these fit neatly
in the \AR{Semantics} framework.

Now we wish to focus on other instances of \AR{Semantics} that implement
the functions used by different stages of a compiler. Some, like the
scoping (\cref{section:genericscoping}), desugaring (\cref{section:letbinding}),
and inlining (\cref{section:inlining}) passes will be fully generic
while others like the typechecking (\cref{section:typechecking}) and
elaboration (\cref{section:elaboration}) passes will correspond to a
specific language and its particular type system.
