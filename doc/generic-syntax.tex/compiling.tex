\chapter{Generic Compiler Passes and Compiler Passes as Semantics}

In the previous chapter we have seen various generic semantics one may be
interested in when working on a deeply embedded language: renaming,
substitution, printing with names or evaluation. All of these fit neatly
in the \AR{Semantics} framework.

Now we wish to focus on the kind of traversals one may find in a compiler
pipeline such as a generic scopechecker, an elaboration function from an
untyped surface syntax to an intrinsically typed syntax, or an optimisation
pass inlining definitions used at most once.

All of the examples but the scopechecker are instances of \AR{Semantics}.
Some, like the scoping (\cref{section:genericscoping}), desugaring
(\cref{section:letbinding}), and inlining (\cref{section:inlining}) passes
will be fully generic while others like the typechecking
(\cref{section:typechecking}) and elaboration (\cref{section:elaboration})
passes will correspond to a specific language and its particular type
system.
