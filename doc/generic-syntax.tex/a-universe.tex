\chapter{A Plea For a Universe of Syntaxes with Binding}

Now that we have a way to structure our traversals and proofs about them,
we can tackle a practical example. Let us look at the formalisation of an
apparently straightforward program transformation: the inlining of let-bound
variables by substitution and the proof of a simple correctness lemma.

In this exercise we have two languages: the source (\AD{S}), which has
let-bindings, and the target (\AD{T}), which only differs in that it does
not. We want to write a function elaborating source terms into target ones
and then prove that each reduction step on the source term can be simulated
by zero or more reduction steps on its elaboration.

Breaking the task down, we need to start by defining the two languages.
We already know how to do this from \cref{sec:scopedtypedterms}. In a
textbook such as Pierce's (\citeyear{DBLP:books/daglib/0005958}) we
would simply start by defining \AD{T} and then state that \AD{S} is
\AD{T} extended with let bindings.

\[\begin{array}{lcl}
$<T>$ & ∷= & x ~∣~ $<T>$ $<T>$ ~∣~ λx.$<T>$ \\
$<S>$ & ∷= & ⋯ ~|~ \mathtt{let}~ x ~=~ $<S>$ ~\mathtt{in}~ $<S>$ \\
\end{array}
\]

When formalising this definition however we need to write down the same
constructor types twice for \AIC{`var}, \AIC{`lam}, and \AIC{`app} as
demonstrated in \cref{fig:sourcetarget}.

\begin{figure}[h]

    \ExecuteMetaData[generic-syntax.agda/Motivation/Problem/Naive.tex]{target}
  \end{minipage}
  \caption{Source and Target Languages}\label{fig:sourcetarget}
\end{figure}

Ignoring for now the \AR{Semantics} framework, we jump straight to
defining the program transformation we are interested in. Given an
environment of target terms, it will elaborate a source term into a
target one.

Informally, we could state that it proceeds by a simple case distinction.
On the one hand all the constructors that exist in both languages should
be mapped to their immediate counterpart and their subterms recursively
simplified. And on the other a let-binding should be elaborated away by
elaborating the let-bound expression first, putting the result into the
evaluation environment and returning the result of elaborating the body
in the thus extended environment.

In practice however things are more complex. We notice immediately that
we need to prove \AD{T} to be \AF{Thinnable} first so that we may push
the environment of inlined terms under binders. And even though our informal
description highlighted that all cases but one are purely structural, we
still need to painstakingly go through them one by one.

\end{figure}

We now want to state our correctness lemma: each reduction step on a source
term can be simulated by zero or more reduction steps on its elaboration.
We need to define an operational semantics for each language. We only show
the one for \AD{S} in \cref{fig:opersem}: the one for \AD{T} is exactly the
same minus the \AIC{`let}-related rules. We immediately notice that to write
down the type of \AIC{β} we need to define substitution (and thus renaming)
for each of the languages.

\begin{figure}[h]
\ExecuteMetaData[generic-syntax.agda/Motivation/Problem/Naive.tex]{redS}
\caption{Operational Semantics for the Source Language\label{fig:opersem}}
\end{figure}

In the course of simply stating our problem, we have already had to define
two eerily similar languages, spell out all the purely structural cases
when defining the transformation we are interested in and implement four
auxiliary traversals which are essentially the same.

In the course of proving the correctness lemma (which we abstain from
doing here), we discover that we need to prove eight lemmas about the
interactions of renaming, substitution, and let-inlining. They are all
remarkably similar, but must be stated and proved separately (e.g, as
in \cite{benton2012strongly}).

Even after doing all of this work, we have only a result for a single pair of
source and target languages. If we were to change our languages \AD{S} or
\AD{T}, we would have to repeat the same work all over again or at least do a
lot of cutting, pasting, and editing. And if we add more constructs to both
languages, we will have to extend our transformation with more and more code
that essentially does nothing of interest.

This state of things is not inevitable. After having implemented numerous
semantics in \cref{type-scope-semantics}, we have gained an important insight:
the structure of the constraints telling us how to define a \AR{Semantics} is
tightly coupled to the definition of the language. So much so that we should
in fact be able to \emph{derive} them directly from the definition of the
language.

This is what we set out to do in this part and in particular in
\cref{section:letbinding} where we define a \emph{generic} notion of
let-binding to extend any language with together with the corresponding
generic let-inlining transformation.
