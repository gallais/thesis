\section{Printing with Names}\label{section:genericprinting}

Coming back to our work on (rudimentary) printing with names in
\cref{prettyprint}, we can now give a generic account of it. This is a
particularly interesting example because it demonstrates that we may
sometimes want to give \AD{Desc} a different semantics to accommodate
a specific use-case: we do not want our users to deal explicitly with
name generation, explicit variable binding, etc.

Unlike renaming or substitution, this generic program will require user
guidance: there is no way for us to guess how an encoded term should be
printed. We can however take care of the name generation, deal with variable
binding, and implement the traversal generically. We are going to reuse
some of the components defined in \cref{prettyprint}: we can rely on the
same state monad (\AF{Fresh}) for name generation, the same \AF{fresh}
function and the same notions of \AF{Name} and \AF{Printer} for the
semantics' values and computations.
%
We want our printer to have type:
\begin{agdasnippet}
\ExecuteMetaData[generic-syntax.agda/Generic/Semantics/Printing.tex]{printtype}
\end{agdasnippet}
%
where \AF{Display} explains how to print one `layer' of term provided that
we are handed the \AF{Pieces} corresponding to the printed subterm and
names for the bound variables.
%
\begin{agdasnippet}
  \ExecuteMetaData[generic-syntax.agda/Generic/Semantics/Printing.tex]{display}
\end{agdasnippet}
%
Reusing the notion of \AR{Name} introduced in Section~\ref{prettyprint},
we can make \AF{Pieces} formal.
%
The structure of \AR{Semantics} would suggest giving our users an interface
where sub-structures are interpreted as \AF{Kripke} function spaces expecting
fresh names for the fresh variables and returning a printer i.e. a monadic
computation returning a \AD{String}. However we can do better: we can
preemptively generate a set of fresh names for the newly bound variables and
hand them to the user together with the result of printing the body with
these names. As usual we have a special case for the substructures without
any newly bound variable. Note that the specific target context of the
environment of \AF{Name}s is only picked for convenience as \AF{Name}
ignores the scope: ({\AB{Δ} \AF{++} \AB{Γ}}) is what \AF{freshˡ} gives us.
%
In other words: \AF{Pieces} states that a subterm has already been printed
if we have a string representation of it together with an environment of
\AR{Name}s we have attached to the newly bound variables this structure
contains.
%
\begin{agdasnippet}
\ExecuteMetaData[generic-syntax.agda/Generic/Semantics/Printing.tex]{pieces}
\end{agdasnippet}
%
The key observation that will help us define a generic printer is that
\AF{Fresh} composed with \AR{Name} is \AR{VarLike}. Indeed, as the
composition of a functor and a trivially thinnable \AR{Wrap}per,
\AF{Fresh} is \AF{Thinnable}, and \AF{fresh} (defined in
Figure~\ref{fig:freshname}) is the proof that we can generate
placeholder values thanks to the name supply.

\begin{agdasnippet}
\ExecuteMetaData[generic-syntax.agda/Generic/Semantics/Printing.tex]{vlmname}
\end{agdasnippet}

This \AR{VarLike} instance empowers us to reify in an effectful manner
a \AF{Kripke} function space taking \AF{Name}s and returning a \AF{Printer}
to a set of \AF{Pieces}.

\begin{agdasnippet}
\ExecuteMetaData[generic-syntax.agda/Generic/Semantics/Printing.tex]{reifytype}
\end{agdasnippet}

In case there are no newly bound variables, the \AF{Kripke} function space
collapses to a mere \AR{Printer} which is precisely the wrapped version of
the type we expect.

\begin{agdasnippet}
\ExecuteMetaData[generic-syntax.agda/Generic/Semantics/Printing.tex]{reifybase}
\end{agdasnippet}

Otherwise we proceed in a manner reminiscent of the pure reification function
defined in Figure~\ref{fig:kripkereify}. We start by generating an environment
of names for the newly bound variables by using the fact that \AF{Fresh} composed
with \AF{Name} is \AR{VarLike} together with the fact that environments are
Traversable~\cite{mcbride_paterson_2008}, %%%
and thus admit the standard Haskell-like \AF{mapA} and \AF{sequenceA}
traversals. %%%
We then run the \AF{Kripke} function
on these names to obtain the string representation of the subterm. We finally
return the names we used together with this string.

\begin{agdasnippet}
\ExecuteMetaData[generic-syntax.agda/Generic/Semantics/Printing.tex]{reifypieces}
\end{agdasnippet}

We can put all of these pieces together to obtain the \AF{Printing} semantics
presented in Figure~\ref{fig:genericprinting}.
The first two constraints can be trivially discharged. When defining the
algebra we start by reifying the subterms, then use the fact that  one ``layer''
of term of our syntaxes with binding is always traversable to combine all of
these results into a value we can apply our display function to.

\ExecuteMetaData[generic-syntax.agda/Generic/Semantics/Printing.tex]{printing}
\caption{Printing with \AF{Name}s as a \AR{Semantics}}\label{fig:genericprinting}
\end{figure}

This allows us to write a \AF{printer} for open terms as demonstrated in
Figure~\ref{fig:genericprint}.
We start by using \AF{base} (defined in Section~\ref{sec:varlike:base})
to generate an environment of \AR{Name}s for the free variables, then use
our semantics to get a \AF{printer} which we can run using a stream \AF{names} of distinct
strings as our name supply.

\end{figure}


\paragraph{Untyped λ-calculus} Defining a printer for the untyped
λ-calculus is now very easy: we define a \AF{Display} by case analysis.
In the application case, we combine the string representation of the
function, wrap its argument's representation between parentheses and
concatenate the two together. In the lambda abstraction case, we are
handed the name the bound variable was assigned together with the body's
representation; it is once more a matter of putting the \AF{Pieces}
together.

\begin{agdasnippet}
\ExecuteMetaData[generic-syntax.agda/Generic/Examples/Printing.tex]{printUTLC}
\end{agdasnippet}

As always, these functions are readily executable and we can check
their behaviour by writing tests. First, we print the identity function
defined in Figure~\ref{fig:identity}
in an empty context and verify that we do obtain the string \AStr{"λa. a"}.
Next, we print an open term in a context of size two and can immediately
observe that names are generated for the free variables first, and then the
expression itself is printed.
