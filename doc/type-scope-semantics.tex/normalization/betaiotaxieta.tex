\label{normbye}

In the case of NBE, the environment values and the computations in the model
will both use the same type family \AF{Model}, defined by induction on the
\AD{Type} argument. The Œ∑-rules allow us to represent functions (respectively
inhabitants of \AIC{`Unit}) in the source language as function spaces
(respectively values of type \AR{‚ä§}). Evaluating a \AIC{`Bool} may however
yield a stuck term so we can't expect the model to give us anything more than
an open term in normal form.

The model construction then follows the usual pattern pioneered by
Berger~(\citeyear{berger1993program}) and formally analysed and thoroughly
explained by Catarina Coquand~(\citeyear{coquand2002formalised}). We work
by induction on the type and describe Œ∑-expanded values: all inhabitants
of (\AF{Model} \AIC{`Unit} \AB{Œì}) are equal and all elements
of (\AF{Model} (\AB{œÉ} \AIC{`‚Üí} \AB{œÑ}) \AB{Œì}) are functions in Agda.

\end{figure}

This model is defined by induction on the type in terms either of
syntactic objects (\AD{Nf}) or using the \AF{‚ñ°}-operator which is
a closure operator for thinnings. As such, it is trivial to prove
that for all type \AB{œÉ}, (\AF{Model} \AB{œÉ}) is \AF{Thinnable}.

\end{figure}

Application's semantic counterpart is easy to define: given that \AB{ùì•}
and \AB{ùìí} are equal in this instance definition we can feed the argument
directly to the function, with the identity renaming. This corresponds to
\AF{extract} for the comonad \AF{‚ñ°}.

\end{figure}

Conditional branching however is more subtle: the boolean value \AIC{`if} branches on
may be a neutral term in which case the whole elimination form is stuck. This forces
us to define \AF{reify} and \AF{reflect} first. These functions, also known as quote
and unquote respectively, give the interplay between neutral terms, model values and
normal forms. \AF{reflect} performs a form of semantic Œ∑-expansion: all stuck \AIC{`Unit}
terms are equated and all functions are Œª-headed. It allows us to define \AF{var0}, the
semantic counterpart of (\AIC{`var} \AIC{z}).

\caption{Reify and Reflect\label{fig:reifyreflectnbe}}
\end{figure}

We can then give the semantics of \AIC{`ifte}: if the boolean is a value, the
appropriate branch is picked; if it is stuck then the whole expression is stuck.
It is then turned into a neutral form by reifying the two branches and then reflected
in the model.

\end{figure}

We can then combine these components. The semantics of a Œª-abstraction is simply the
identity function: the structure of the functional case in the definition of the model
matches precisely the shape expected in a \AF{Semantics}. Because the environment
carries model values, the variable case is trivial.

\end{figure}

We can define a normaliser by kickstarting the evaluation with an environment of
placeholder values obtained by reflecting the term's free variables and then reifying
the result.
