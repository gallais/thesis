\chapter{Refactoring Common Traversals}

A programmer implementing an embedded language with bindings has a
wealth of possibilities. However, should she want to be able to inspect
the terms produced by her users in order to optimise or even compile
them, she will have to work with a deep embedding. Which means that she
will have to (re)implement a great number of traversals doing such
mundane things as renaming, substitution, or partial evaluation.
Should she want to get help from the typechecker in order to fend
off common bugs, she can opt for inductive families~\cite{dybjer1991inductive}
to enforce precise invariants. But the traversals now have to be
invariant preserving too!

\section{McBride's Kit}

In an unpublished manuscript, McBride~(\citeyear{mcbride2005type})
observes the similarity between the types and implementations of
renaming and substitution for the simply typed $λ$-calculus (ST$λ$C) in a
dependently typed language as shown in \cref{ren}. There are three
differences between the implemenations of renaming and substitution:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item
    in the variable case, after renaming a variable we must wrap it
    in a \AIC{`var} constructor whereas a substitution directly
    produces a term;
  \item
    when weakening a renaming to push it under a $λ$ we need only
    post-compose the remaning with the De Bruijn variable successor
    constructor \AIC{s} (which is essentially weakening for variables)
    whereas for a substitution we need a weakening operation for terms.
    It can be given by renaming via the successor constructor
    (\AF{ren} (\AIC{pack} \AIC{s}));
  \item
    also in the $λ$ case, when pushing a renaming or a substitution under
    a binder we must extend it to ensure that the variable bound by the
    $λ$ is mapped to itself. For renaming this involves its extension by
    the zeroth variable \AIC{z} whereas for subsitutions we must extend by
    the zeroth variable seen as a term (\AIC{`var} \AIC{z}).
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}[h]

\caption{Renaming\label{ren} and Substitution\label{sub} for the ST$λ$C}
\end{figure}

McBride then defines a notion of ``Kit'' abstracting these differences.
Rather than considering \AD{Var} and \AD{Tm} in isolation as different
types of environment values, he considers \AB{⧫}, an arbitrary
(\AD{Type} \AR{−Scoped}) and designs three constraints:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item
    One should be able to turn any environment value into a term of
    the same type and defined in the same scope (\ARF{var});
  \item
    One should be able to craft a fresh environment value associated
    to the zeroth variable of a scope (\ARF{zro});
  \item
    One should be able to embed environment values defined in a given
    scope into ones in a scope extended with a fresh variable (\ARF{wkn}).
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}[h]
\ExecuteMetaData[type-scope-semantics.agda/StateOfTheArt/McBride05/Base.tex]{kitdef}
\caption{\AR{Kit} as a set of constraints on \AB{⧫}}
\end{figure}

Whenever these constraints are met we can define a type and scope preserving
traversal which is based on an environment of \AB{⧫}-values. This is the
fundamental lemma of \AR{Kit}s:

\begin{figure}[h]
\ExecuteMetaData[type-scope-semantics.agda/StateOfTheArt/McBride05/Kit.tex]{kitsem}
\caption{Fundamental lemma of \AR{Kit}}
\end{figure}

Thankfully, we can indeed recover renaming and substitution as two instances of
the fundamental lemma of \AR{Kit}s. We start with the \AR{Kit} for renaming
and \AF{ren} defined this time as a corrolary of \AF{kit}

\begin{figure}[h]

\end{minipage}
\caption{\AR{Kit} for Renaming, Renaming as a Corrolary of \AF{kit}\label{fig:renkit}}
\end{figure}

Just like we needed \AF{ren} to define \AF{sub}, once we have recovered \AF{ren}
we can define the \AR{Kit} for substitution.

\section{Opportunities for Further Generalizations}

After noticing that renaming and substitution fit the pattern, it is
natural to wonder about other traversals.

The evaluation function used in normalization by evaluation, although
not fitting \emph{exactly} in the \AR{Kit}-based approach, relies on
the same general structure. The variable case is nothing more than a
lookup in the environment; the application case is defined by combining
the results of two structural calls; and the lambda case corresponds to
the evaluation of the lambda's body in an extended context provided that
we can get a value for the newly-bound variable. Ignoring for now the
definitions of \AF{APP} and \AF{LAM}, we can see the similarities
in~\cref{nbe}.

\begin{figure}[h]
\ExecuteMetaData[type-scope-semantics.agda/StateOfTheArt/McBride05/Base.tex]{nbe}
\caption{Normalisation by Evaluation for the ST$λ$C\label{nbe}}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Outline} Building on this observation, our contributions
here are twofold:

\begin{itemize}
  \item
    We generalise the ``Kit'' approach from syntax to semantics bringing
    operations like normalisation by evaluation (cf.~\cref{nbe}) but also
    printing with a name supply, or continutation passing style translation
    into our framework.

  \item
    We prove generic results about simulations between and fusions of
    semantics given by, and enabled by, Kit.
\end{itemize}

We start by defining the simple calculus we will
use as a running example. We then introduce a notion of environments
and one well known instance: the category of renamings. This leads us
to defining a generic notion of type and scope-preserving Semantics
together with a generic evaluation function. We then showcase the
ground covered by these Semantics: from the syntactic ones
corresponding to renaming and substitution to printing with names,
variations of Normalisation by Evaluation or CPS transformations.
Finally, given the generic
definition of Semantics, we can prove fundamental lemmas about these
evaluation functions: we characterise the semantics which can simulate
one another and give an abstract treatment of composition yielding
compaction and reuse of proofs compared to Benton et
al.~(\citeyear{benton2012strongly}).

\section{The Calculus and Its Embedding}

We work with a deeply embedded simply typed λ-calculus (STλC). It has \unit{} and \bool{}
as base types and serves as a minimal example of a system with a record type equipped
with an η-rule and a sum type. We describe the types both as a grammar and the
corresponding inductive type in Agda in~\cref{fig:type}.

\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{minipage}{0.5\textwidth}
\[
\begin{array}{lcl}
\nonterminal{\type{}}
  & ::=    & \unit{}
  ~ \mid{} ~ \bool{} \\

\end{array}
\]

\end{array}
\]
\caption{Grammar of our Language\label{fig:grammar:term}}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Well Scoped by Construction}

To talk about the variables in scope and their type, we need \emph{contexts}. We
choose to represent them as lists of types; \AIC{[]} denotes the empty list and
(\AB{σ} \AIC{∷} \AB{Γ}) the list \AB{Γ} extended with a fresh variable of type \AB{σ}.

\todo{introduce scoped}

\begin{figure}[h]
\ExecuteMetaData[shared/Data/Var.tex]{scoped}
\caption{\label{fig:scoped}}
\end{figure}


Variables are then positions in such a context represented as typed de
Bruijn~(\citeyear{de1972lambda}) indices. This amounts to an inductive definition
of context membership. We use the combinators defined above to show only local
changes to the context.

\begin{figure}[h]
\ExecuteMetaData[shared/Data/Var.tex]{var}
\caption{Well Scoped and Typed de Bruijn indices\label{fig:variable}}
\end{figure}

The syntax for this calculus guarantees that terms are well scoped-and-typed
by construction. This presentation due to
Altenkirch and Reus~(\citeyear{altenkirch1999monadic}) relies heavily on
Dybjer's~(\citeyear{dybjer1991inductive}) inductive families. Rather than
having untyped pre-terms and a typing relation assigning a type to
them, the typing rules are here enforced in the syntax. Notice that
the only use of \AF{\_⊢\_} to extend the context is for the body of
a \AIC{λ}.

\begin{figure}[h]
\ExecuteMetaData[type-scope-semantics.agda/Syntax/Calculus.tex]{term}
\caption{Well Scoped and Typed Calculus\label{fig:term}}
\end{figure}

\section{A Generic Notion of Environment}

All the semantics we are interested in defining associate to a term \AB{t}
of type \AD{Term} \AB{σ} \AB{Γ}, a value of type \AB{𝓒} \AB{σ} \AB{Δ} given
an interpretation \AB{𝓥} \AB{Δ} {τ} for each one of its free variables
\AB{τ} in \AB{Γ}. We call the collection of these interpretations an
\AB{𝓥}-(evaluation) environment. We leave out \AB{𝓥} when it can easily
be inferred from the context.

The content of environments may vary wildly between different semantics:
when defining renaming, the environments will carry variables whilst the
ones used for normalisation by evaluation contain elements of the model.
But their structure stays the same which prompts us to define the notion
of evaluation environment generically for any (\AB{I} \AR{−Scoped}).

Formally, this translates to \AB{𝓥}-environments being the
pointwise lifting of the relation \AB{𝓥} between contexts and types to a
relation between two contexts. Rather than using a datatype to represent
such a lifting, we choose to use a function space. This decision is based
on Jeffrey's observation~(\citeyear{jeffrey2011assoc}) that one can obtain
associativity of append for free by using difference lists. In our case the
interplay between various combinators (e.g. \AF{refl} and \AF{select})
defined later on is vastly simplified by this rather simple decision.

\begin{figure}[h]
\ExecuteMetaData[shared/Data/Environment.tex]{env}
\caption{Generic Notion of Environment\label{fig:env}}
\end{figure}

Just as an environment interprets variables in model, a computation gives a meaning
to terms into a model. We can define \AF{─Comp} to make this parallel explicit.

\begin{figure}[h]
\ExecuteMetaData[type-scope-semantics.agda/Semantics/Specification.tex]{comp}
\caption{Generic Notion of Computation\label{fig:comp}}
\end{figure}

An appropriate notion of semantics for the calculus is one that
will map environments to computations. In other words, a set of
constraints on $𝓥$ and $𝓒$ guaranteeing the existence of a function
of type ((\AB{Γ} \AR{─Env}) \AB{𝓥} \AB{Δ} \AS{→} (\AB{Γ} \AF{─Comp}) \AB{𝓒} \AB{Δ}).

These environments naturally behave like the contexts they are indexed by:
there is a trivial environment for the empty context and one can easily
extend an existing one by providing an appropriate value. The packaging of
the function representing to the environment in a record allows for two
things: it helps the typechecker by stating explicitly which type family
the values correspond to and it empowers us to define environments by
copattern-matching~\cite{abel2013copatterns} thus defining environments
by their use cases.

\caption{Constructing Environments with Combinators\label{fig:envcombinators}}
\end{figure}

\subsection{The Category of Thinnings}
\label{sec:categoryrenamings}

A key instance of environments playing a predominant role in this paper is the
notion of thinning. The reader may be accustomed to the more restrictive
notion of renamings as described variously as Order Preserving
Embeddings~\cite{chapman2009type}, thinnings (which we use), context
inclusions, or just weakenings~\cite{altenkirch1995categorical}.
Writing non-injective or non-order
preserving renamings would take perverse effort given that we only
implement generic interpretations. In practice, although the type of
thinnings is more generous, we only introduce weakenings (skipping
variables at the beginning of the context) that become thinnings
(skipping variables at arbitrary points in the context) when we push
them under binders.

A thinning (\AF{Thinning} \AB{Γ} \AB{Δ}) is an environment pairing each variable
of type \AB{σ} in \AB{Γ} to one of the same type in \AB{Δ}.

\begin{figure}[h]
\ExecuteMetaData[shared/Data/Environment.tex]{thinning}
\caption{Thinning as Environments\label{fig:thinnings}}
\end{figure}

\todo{use Thinnable from generic-syntax}

We formulate a thinning principle called \AF{Thinnable}. By a ``thinning
principle'', we mean that if \AB{P} holds of \AB{Γ} and we have a proof
(\AF{Thinning} \AB{Γ} \AB{Δ}) then \AB{P} holds for \AB{Δ} too. In the
case of variables, thinning merely corresponds to applying the renaming
function in order to obtain a new variable. The environments' case is also
quite simple: being a pointwise lifting of a relation \AB{𝓥} between
contexts and types, they enjoy thinning if \AB{𝓥} does.

\begin{figure}[h]
\ExecuteMetaData[shared/Data/Environment.tex]{thinnable}
\caption{Thinning Principle and Instances for \AF{Var} and \AR{─Env}\label{fig:thinnable}}
\end{figure}

These simple observations allow us to prove that thinnings
form a category which, in turn, lets us provide the user with the
constructors Altenkirch, Hofmann and Streicher's ``Category of
Weakening"~(\citeyear{altenkirch1995categorical}) is based on.

The modal operator \AF{□} states that a given predicate holds for
all thinnings of a context. It is a closure operator for \AF{Thinnable}.

Now that we are equipped with the notion of inclusion, we have all
the pieces necessary to describe the Kripke structure of our models
of the simply typed λ-calculus.

\section{Semantics and Their Generic Evaluators}

The upcoming sections demonstrate that renaming, substitution, printing with names,
and normalisation by evaluation all share the same structure. We start by abstracting
away a notion of \AR{Semantics} encompassing all these constructions. This approach
will make it possible for us to implement a generic traversal parametrised by such
a \AR{Semantics} once and for all and to focus on the interesting model constructions
instead of repeating the same pattern over and over again.

A \AR{Semantics} is indexed by two (\AD{Type} \AR{−Scoped}) type families
\AB{𝓥} and \AB{𝓒} describing respectively the values in the environment
and the computations the evaluator will deliver. In cases such as substitution
or normalisation by evaluation, \AB{𝓥} and \AB{𝓒} will happen to coincide but
keeping these two relations distinct is precisely what makes it possible to go
beyond these and also model renaming or printing with names.

Concretely, we define \AR{Semantics} as a record packing the properties these
families need to satisfy for the evaluation function to exist.

\ExecuteMetaData[type-scope-semantics.agda/Semantics/Specification.tex]{semantics}

The type we chose for \ARF{lam} makes the \AF{Semantics} notion
powerful enough that even logical predicates are instances of it. And we
indeed exploit this power when defining normalisation by evaluation
as a semantics: the model construction is, after all, nothing but a logical
predicate. As a consequence it seems rather natural to call \AF{sem}, the
fundamental lemma of semantics. We prove it in a module parameterised by a
\AF{Semantics}, which would correspond to using a Section in Coq. It is
defined by structural recursion on the term. Each constructor is replaced
by its semantic counterpart which combines the induction hypotheses
for its subterms.

\begin{figure}[h]
\ExecuteMetaData[type-scope-semantics.agda/Semantics/Specification.tex]{fundamental}
\caption{Fundamental Lemma of \AR{Semantics}\label{fig:fundsem}}
\end{figure}

\section{Syntax Is the Identity Semantics}
\label{syntactic}

As we have explained earlier, this work has been directly influenced by
McBride's ~(\citeyear{mcbride2005type}) manuscript. It seems appropriate
to start our exploration of \AR{Semantics} with the two operations he
implements as a single traversal. We call these operations syntactic
because the computations in the model are actual terms and almost all term
constructors are kept as their own semantic counterpart. As observed by
McBride, it is enough to provide three operations describing the properties
of the values in the environment to get a full-blown \AR{Semantics}. This
fact is witnessed by our simple \AR{Syntactic} record type together with
the \AF{syntactic} function turning its inhabitants into associated
\AR{Semantics}.

\begin{figure}[h]
\ExecuteMetaData[type-scope-semantics.agda/Semantics/Syntactic/Specification.tex]{syntactic}
\ExecuteMetaData[type-scope-semantics.agda/Semantics/Syntactic/Specification.tex]{syntacticsem}
\caption{Every \AR{Syntactic} gives rise to a \AR{Semantics}\label{fig:syntactic}}
\end{figure}

The shape of \ARF{lam} or \ARF{one} should not trick the reader
into thinking that this definition performs some sort of η-expansion:
the fundamental \AF{lemma} indeed only ever uses one of these when the
evaluated term's head constructor is already respectively a \AIC{`lam}
or a \AIC{`one}. It is therefore absolutely possible to define renaming
or substitution using this approach. We can now port McBride's definitions
to our framework.


\subsection{Functoriality, also known as Renaming}

Our first example of a \AR{Syntactic} operation works with variables as
environment values. We have already defined thinning earlier (see
Section \ref{category}) and we can turn a variable into a term by using
the \AIC{`var} constructor. The type of \AF{sem} specialised to this
semantics is then precisely the proof that terms are thinnable.

\begin{figure}[h]

\ExecuteMetaData[type-scope-semantics.agda/Semantics/Syntactic/Instances.tex]{ren}
\caption{Thinning as a \AR{Syntactic} Instance\label{fig:synren}}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Simultaneous Substitution}

Our second example of a semantics is another spin on the syntactic model:
environment values are now terms. We get thinning for terms from the
previous example. Again, specialising the type of \AF{sem}
reveals that it delivers precisely the simultaneous substitution.

\begin{figure}[h]

\caption{Parallel Substitution as a \AR{Syntactic} Instance\label{fig:synren}}
\end{figure}

\section{Printing with Names}
\label{prettyprint}

Before considering the various model constructions involved in defining
normalisation functions deciding different equational theories, let us
make a detour to a perhaps slightly more surprising example of a
\AF{Semantics}: printing with names. A user-facing project would naturally
avoid directly building a \AD{String} and rather construct an inhabitant of
a more sophisticated datatype in order to generate a prettier output~\cite{hughes1995design,wadler2003prettier}.
But we stick to the simpler setup as \emph{pretty} printing is not our focus here.

This example is interesting for two reasons. Firstly, the distinction between
values and computations is once more instrumental: we get to give the procedure
a precise type guiding our implementation. The environment carries \emph{names}
for the variables currently in scope whilst the computations thread a name-supply
(a stream of strings) to be used to generate fresh names for bound variables.
If the values in the environment had to be computations too, we would not root
out some faulty implementations e.g a program picking a new name each time a
variable is mentioned.

Secondly, the fact that the model's computation type is a monad and that this
poses no problem whatsoever in this framework means it is appropriate for
handling languages with effects~\cite{moggi1991notions}, or effectful
semantics e.g. logging the various function calls. Here is the full definition
of the printer.

\begin{figure}[h]

\ExecuteMetaData[type-scope-semantics.agda/Semantics/Printing.tex]{printer}
\end{minipage}
\caption{Names and Printer for the Printing Semantics\label{fig:semprint}}
\end{figure}

\ExecuteMetaData[type-scope-semantics.agda/Semantics/Printing.tex]{printing}

The fundamental \AF{lemma} of \AR{Semantics} will deliver a printer which needs to be run
on a \AD{Stream} of distinct \AD{String}s. Our definition of \AF{names} (not
shown here) simply cycles through the letters of the alphabet and guarantess
uniqueness by appending a natural number incremented each time we are back at
the beginning of the cycle. This crude name generation strategy would naturally
be replaced with a more sophisticated one in a user-facing language: we could
e.g. use naming hints for user-introduced binders and type-based schemes otherwise
($f$ or $g$ for functions, $i$ or $j$ for integers, etc.).

In order to kickstart the evaluation, we still need to provide \AR{Name}s
for each one of the free variables in scope. We deliver that environment
by a simple stateful computation \AF{init} chopping off an initial segment
of the name supply of the appropriate length. The definition of \AF{print}
follows.

\begin{figure}[h]
\ExecuteMetaData[type-scope-semantics.agda/Semantics/Printing.tex]{print}
\caption{Printer\label{fig:printer}}
\end{figure}

We can observe \AF{print}'s behaviour by writing a test; we state it as a
propositional equality and prove it using \AIC{refl}, forcing the typechecker
to check that both expressions indeed compute to the same normal form. Here
we display the identity function defined in a context of size 2. As we can see,
the binder receives the name \AStr{"c"} because \AStr{"a"} and \AStr{"b"} have
already been assigned to the free variables in scope.
