\chapter{Refactoring Common Traversals}

Once they have a good representation for their language, they will have to
(re)implement a great number of traversals doing such mundane things as
renaming, substitution, or partial evaluation. Should they want to get help
from the typechecker in order to fend off common bugs, they will have opted
for inductive families (\cite{dybjer1991inductive}) to enforce precise
invariants. But the traversals now have to be invariant preserving too!

\section{A Generic Notion of Environment}
\label{sec:genenvironment}

Renamings and substitutions have in common that they map variables
to something: other variables in one case, terms in the other. We
can abstract over these differences and provide users with a generic
notion of environment that may be used in both cases.

Assuming that we are given an (\AB{I}-\AR{Scoped}) family \AB{𝓥}
corresponding to a notion of values variables should be mapped to,
we call \AB{𝓥}-(evaluation) environment this generalisation of both
renamings and substitutions. We leave out \AB{𝓥} when it can easily
be inferred from the context.

Formally, this translates to \AB{𝓥}-environments being the pointwise
lifting of the relation \AB{𝓥} between contexts and types to a relation
between two contexts. Rather than using a datatype to represent such a
lifting, we choose to use a function space.
%
This decision is based on Jeffrey's observation~(\citeyear{jeffrey2011assoc})
that one can obtain associativity of append for free by using difference lists.
In our case the interplay between various combinators (e.g. \AF{identity} and
\AF{select}) defined later on is vastly simplified by this rather simple
decision.

\begin{figure}[h]
\ExecuteMetaData[shared/Data/Environment.tex]{env}
\caption{Generic Notion of Environment\label{fig:env}}
\end{figure}

We write {((\AB{Γ} \AR{─Env}) \AB{𝓥} \AB{Δ})} for an environment that
associates a value \AB{𝓥} well scoped and typed in \AB{Δ} to every
entry in \AB{Γ}.
%
These environments naturally behave like the contexts they are indexed by:
there is a trivial environment for the empty context and one can easily
extend an existing one by providing an appropriate value. The packaging of
the function representing to the environment in a record allows for two
things: it helps the typechecker by stating explicitly which type family
the values correspond to and it empowers us to define environments by
copattern-matching (\cite{abel2013copatterns}) thus defining environments
by their use cases.

\label{fig:envcombinators}

The definition of the empty environment uses an absurd match (\AS{()}): given
the definition of \AD{Var} in \cref{fig:variable}, it should be pretty clear
that there can never be a value of type ({\AD{Var} \AB{σ} \AIC{[]}}).

\begin{figure}[h]
\ExecuteMetaData[shared/Data/Environment.tex]{empty}
\caption{Empty Environment\label{fig:emptyenv}}
\end{figure}

The environment extension definition proceeds by pattern-matching on the
variable: if it \AIC{z} then we return the newly-added value, otherwise we are
referring to a value in the original environment and can simply look it up.

\begin{figure}[h]
\ExecuteMetaData[shared/Data/Environment.tex]{extension}
\caption{Environment Extension\label{fig:envextend}}
\end{figure}

We also include the definition of \AF{\_<\$>\_}, which lifts in a
pointwise manner a function acting on values into a function acting
on environment of such values.

\begin{figure}[h]
\ExecuteMetaData[shared/Data/Environment.tex]{envmap}
\caption{Environment Mapping}\label{fig:baseenv}
\end{figure}

Now that we have a generic notion of environment, we can focus on
refactoring various traversals as instances of a more general one.

\section{McBride's Kit}

McBride observed the similarity between the types and implementations of renaming
and substitution for a well scoped language in his thesis~(\citeyear{mcbride1999})
and then for the simply typed λ-calculus (STλC) in an unpublished
manuscript~(\citeyear{mcbride2005type}). This work building on Goguen and McKinna's
candidates for substitution~(\citeyear{goguen1997candidates}) and leading to the
collaboration with Benton, Hur, and Kennedy~(\citeyear{benton2012strongly}) teaches
us how to refactor both traversals into a single more general function.

We highlight these similarities for a scope- and type- preserving
implementation of renaming and substitution in~\cref{ren}, focusing
only on \AIC{`var}, \AIC{`app}, and \AIC{`lam} for the moment as
they allow us to make all of the needed observations.
%
There are three differences between the two functions.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item
    in the variable case, after renaming a variable we must wrap it
    in a \AIC{`var} constructor whereas a substitution directly
    produces a term;
  \item
    when weakening a renaming to push it under a $λ$ we need only
    post-compose the renaming with the De Bruijn variable successor
    constructor \AIC{s} (which is essentially weakening for variables)
    whereas for a substitution we need a weakening operation for terms.
    It can be given by renaming via the successor constructor
    (\AF{ren} (\AIC{pack} \AIC{s}));
  \item
    also in the $λ$ case, when pushing a renaming or a substitution under
    a binder we must extend it to ensure that the variable bound by the
    $λ$ is mapped to itself. For renaming this involves its extension by
    the zeroth variable \AIC{z} whereas for substitutions we must extend by
    the zeroth variable seen as a term (\AIC{`var} \AIC{z}).
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}[h]
\ExecuteMetaData[type-scope-semantics.agda/StateOfTheArt/McBride05/Base.tex]{ren}
\ExecuteMetaData[type-scope-semantics.agda/StateOfTheArt/McBride05/Base.tex]{sub}
\caption{Renaming\label{ren} and Substitution\label{sub} for the ST$λ$C}
\end{figure}

Having spotted the small differences between renaming and substitution,
it is now possible to extract the essence of the the two traversals.
McBride defines a notion of ``Kit'' covering these differences. Rather
than considering \AD{Var} and \AD{Tm} in isolation as different types
of environment values, he considers \AB{⧫}, an arbitrary
(\AD{Type} \AR{−Scoped}) and designs three constraints:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item
    One should be able to turn any environment value into a term of
    the same type and defined in the same scope (\ARF{var});
  \item
    One should be able to craft a fresh environment value associated
    to the zeroth variable of a scope (\ARF{zro});
  \item
    One should be able to embed environment values defined in a given
    scope into ones in a scope extended with a fresh variable (\ARF{wkn}).
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}[h]
\ExecuteMetaData[type-scope-semantics.agda/StateOfTheArt/McBride05/Kit.tex]{kitdef}
\caption{\AR{Kit} as a set of constraints on \AB{⧫}}
\end{figure}

Whenever these constraints are met we can define a type and scope
preserving traversal which is based on an environment of \AB{⧫}-values.
This is the fundamental lemma of \AR{Kit}s stated and proved in \cref{fig:kitlemma}.

\begin{figure}[h]
\ExecuteMetaData[type-scope-semantics.agda/StateOfTheArt/McBride05/Kit.tex]{kitsem}
\caption{Fundamental lemma of \AR{Kit}\label{fig:kitlemma}}
\end{figure}

Thankfully, we can indeed recover renaming and substitution as two instances of
the fundamental lemma of \AR{Kit}s. We start with the \AR{Kit} for renaming
and \AF{ren} defined this time as a corollary of \AF{kit}

\begin{figure}[h]

\end{minipage}
\caption{\AR{Kit} for Renaming, Renaming as a Corollary of \AF{kit}\label{fig:renkit}}
\end{figure}

Just like we needed \AF{ren} to define \AF{sub}, once we have recovered \AF{ren}
we can define the \AR{Kit} for substitution.

\end{figure}

\section{Opportunities for Further Generalizations}

After noticing that renaming and substitution fit the pattern, it is
natural to wonder about other traversals. The observations made here
will set the agenda for the next stage of the development in
Section~\ref{section:generic-semantics}.

The evaluation function used in normalization by evaluation
(cf. Catarina Coquand's~(\citeyear{coquand2002formalised}) work
for instance), although
not fitting \emph{exactly} in the \AR{Kit}-based approach, relies on
the same general structure. The variable case is nothing more than a
lookup in the environment; the application case is defined by combining
the results of two structural calls; and the lambda case corresponds to
the evaluation of the lambda's body in an extended context provided that
we can get a value for the newly-bound variable. Ignoring for now the
definitions of \AF{APP} and \AF{LAM}, we can see the similarities
in~\cref{nbe}.

\begin{figure}[h]
\ExecuteMetaData[type-scope-semantics.agda/StateOfTheArt/McBride05/Kit.tex]{nbe}
\caption{Normalisation by Evaluation for the ST$λ$C\label{nbe}}
\end{figure}

Building on this observation, we are going to generalise the ``Kit''
approach from mere syntactic transformations to full blown semantics
producing values in a given model. This generalisation will bring
operations like
normalisation by evaluation (\cref{sec:variationsnormalisation})
but also printing with a name supply (\cref{prettyprint}),
or various continuation passing style translations (\cref{cps-transformation})
into our framework.

In normalisation by evaluation, the notion of arbitrary extensions of
the context at hand plays a crucial role in the definition of said model.
Indeed, computing with \emph{open} terms implies that model values may be
used in a scope that is not the one they came from: evaluation happily goes
under binders and brings the evaluation environment along.
%
These extensions explain the changes made to the scope between the time a
value was constructed and the time it was used. Provided that values can be
transported along such extensions, they give us a way to get the values at
the scope we need from the ones at the scope we had.

This idea of arbitrary extensions of the context at hand will be crucial
to the definition of our generic notion of
semantics (\cref{section:generic-semantics}). To make it formal,
we need to study a well known instance
of the generic notion of environments introduced in
Section~\ref{sec:genenvironment}: the category of thinnings.

\subsection{The Category of Thinnings}
\label{sec:categoryrenamings}

A key instance of environments playing a predominant role in this paper is the
notion of thinning. The reader may be accustomed to the more restrictive notion
of renamings as described variously as Order Preserving Embeddings
(\cite{chapman2009type}), thinnings (which we use), context inclusions,
or just weakenings (\cite{altenkirch1995categorical}). A thinning
(\AF{Thinning} \AB{Γ} \AB{Δ}) is an environment pairing each variable
of type \AB{σ} in \AB{Γ} to one of the same type in \AB{Δ}.

\begin{figure}[h]
\ExecuteMetaData[shared/Data/Environment.tex]{thinning}
\caption{Thinnings: A Special Case of Environments\label{fig:thinnings}}
\end{figure}

Writing non-injective or non-order preserving renamings would take
perverse effort given that we only implement generic interpretations.
In practice, although the type of thinnings is more generous, we
only introduce weakenings (skipping variables at the beginning of
the context) that become thinnings (skipping variables at arbitrary
points in the context) when we push them under binders. The extra
flexibility will not get in our way, and permits a representation
as a function space which grants us monoid laws ``for free'' as
per Jeffrey's observation (\citeyear{jeffrey2011assoc}).

These simple observations allow us to prove that thinnings form a
category which, in turn, lets us provide the user with the constructors
Altenkirch, Hofmann and Streicher's ``Category of
Weakening''~(\citeyear{altenkirch1995categorical}) is based on.

\end{minipage}

\ExecuteMetaData[shared/Data/Environment.tex]{select}
\caption{Examples of Thinning Combinators\label{fig:extendth}}
\end{figure}

The \AF{□} combinator turns any (\AD{List} \AB{I})-indexed Set into
one that can absorb thinnings. This is accomplished by abstracting
over all possible thinnings from the current scope, akin to an
S4-style necessity modality. The axioms of S4 modal logic incite us
to observe that \AF{□} is not only a functor, as witnessed by
\AF{map\textasciicircum{}□}, but also a comonad: \AF{extract} applies
the identity \AF{Thinning} to its argument, and \AF{duplicate} is obtained
by composing the two \AF{Thinning}s we are given (\AF{select} defined in
\cref{fig:extendth} corresponds to transitivity in the special case
where \AB{𝓥} is \AD{Var}). The expected laws hold trivially thanks
to Jeffrey's trick mentioned above.

\end{minipage}
\caption{The \AF{□} Functor is a Comonad}
\end{figure}

The notion of \AF{Thinnable} is the property of being stable under thinnings;
in other words \AF{Thinnable}s are the coalgebras of \AF{□}.
It is a crucial property for values to have if one wants to be able to push
them under binders. From the comonadic structure we get that
the \AF{□} combinator freely turns any (\AD{List} I)-indexed Set into a
\AF{Thinnable} one.

  \ExecuteMetaData[shared/Data/Environment.tex]{thBox}
\end{minipage}
\caption{Thinning Principle and the Cofree Thinnable \AF{□}\label{fig:Thinnable}}
\end{figure}

Constant families are trivially \AF{Thinnable}. In the case of variables,
thinning merely corresponds to applying the renaming function in order to
obtain a new variable. The environments' case is also quite simple: being
a pointwise lifting of a relation \AB{𝓥} between contexts and types, they
enjoy thinning if \AB{𝓥} does.

\end{minipage}

\caption{Thinnable Instances for Variables and Environments\label{fig:thinVarEnv}}
\end{figure}

Now that we are equipped with the notion of inclusion, we have all
the pieces necessary to describe the Kripke structure of our models
of the simply typed λ-calculus.

\section{Semantics and Their Generic Evaluators}
\label{section:generic-semantics}

The upcoming sections demonstrate that renaming, substitution, and printing
with names all share the same structure. We start by abstracting away a notion
of \AR{Semantics} encompassing all these constructions. This approach will
make it possible for us to implement a generic traversal parametrised by
such a \AR{Semantics} once and for all and to focus on the interesting
model constructions instead of repeating the same pattern over and over
again.

Broadly speaking, a semantics turns our deeply embedded abstract syntax
trees into the shallow embedding of the corresponding parametrised higher
order abstract syntax term (\cite{chlipala2008parametric}). We get a
choice of useful type-and-scope safe traversals by using different `host
languages' for this shallow embedding.

A semantics is parametrised by two (\AD{Type} \AR{−Scoped}) type families
\AB{𝓥} and \AB{𝓒}. Realisation of a semantics will produce a computation
in \AB{𝓒} for every term whose variables are assigned values in \AB{𝓥}.
Just as an environment interprets variables in a model, a computation
gives a meaning to terms into a model. We can define \AF{─Comp} to make
this parallel explicit.

\begin{figure}[h]
\ExecuteMetaData[type-scope-semantics.agda/Semantics/Specification.tex]{comp}
\caption{Generic Notion of Computation\label{fig:comp}}
\end{figure}

An appropriate notion of semantics for the calculus is one that will
map environments to computations. In other words, a set of constraints on
\AB{𝓥} and \AB{𝓒} guaranteeing the existence of a function of type
((\AB{Γ} \AR{─Env}) \AB{𝓥} \AB{Δ} \AS{→} (\AB{Γ} \AF{─Comp}) \AB{𝓒} \AB{Δ}).
In cases such as substitution or normalisation by evaluation,
\AB{𝓥} and \AB{𝓒} will happen to coincide but keeping these two relations
distinct is precisely what makes it possible to go beyond these and
also model renaming or printing with names.

Concretely, we define \AR{Semantics} as a record packing the properties
these families need to satisfy for the evaluation function to exist.

\ExecuteMetaData[type-scope-semantics.agda/Semantics/Specification.tex]{recsem}

In the following paragraphs, we interleave the definition of the record
of constraints \semrec{} with explanations of our choices. It is important
to understand that all of the indented Agda snippets are part of the record's
definition. Some correspond to record fields (highlighted in \ARF{pink})
while others are mere auxiliary definitions (highlighted in \AF{blue}) as
permitted by Agda.

The first method of a \AR{Semantics} deals with environment values. They
need to be thinnable (\ARF{th\textasciicircum{}𝓥}) so that the traversal
may introduce fresh variables when going under a binder whilst keeping
the environment well-scoped.

{
\addtolength{\leftskip}{\parindent}
\ExecuteMetaData[type-scope-semantics.agda/Semantics/Specification.tex]{thV}
}

The structure of the model is quite constrained: each constructor
in the language needs a semantic counterpart. We start with the
two most interesting cases: \ARF{var} and \ARF{lam}. The variable
case bridges the gap between the fact that the environment translates
variables into values \AB{𝓥} but the evaluation function returns
computations \AB{𝓒}.

{
\addtolength{\leftskip}{\parindent}
\ExecuteMetaData[type-scope-semantics.agda/Semantics/Specification.tex]{var}
}

The semantic λ-abstraction is notable for two reasons.
%
First, following Mitchell and Moggi~(\citeyear{mitchell1991kripke}),
its \AF{□}-structure allowing arbitrary extensions of the context is typical
of models à la Kripke  one can find in normalisation by
evaluation~(\cite{berger1991inverse,berger1993program,CoqDybSK,coquand2002formalised}).
%
Second, instead of being a function in the host language taking
computations to computations,  it takes \emph{values} to computations.
This is concisely expressed by the type ({\AF{□} (\AB{𝓥}~\AB{σ} \AF{⇒} \AB{𝓒}~\AB{τ})}).

It matches precisely the fact that the body of a λ-abstraction exposes
one extra free variable, prompting us to extend the environment with a
value for it. In the special case where \AB{𝓥} = \AB{𝓒} (normalisation
by evaluation for instance), we recover the usual Kripke structure.

{
\addtolength{\leftskip}{\parindent}
\ExecuteMetaData[type-scope-semantics.agda/Semantics/Specification.tex]{lam}
}

The remaining fields' types are a direct translation of the types of the
constructor they correspond to: substructures have simply been replaced with
computations thus making these operators ideal to combine induction hypotheses.
For instance, the semantical counterpart of application is an operation that
takes a representation of a function and a representation of an argument and
produces a representation of the result.

{
\addtolength{\leftskip}{\parindent}
\ExecuteMetaData[type-scope-semantics.agda/Semantics/Specification.tex]{cons}
}

The type we chose for \ARF{lam} makes the \AF{Semantics} notion powerful
enough that even logical predicates are instances of it. And we indeed
exploit this power when defining normalisation by evaluation as a semantics:
the model construction is, after all, nothing but a logical predicate.
As a consequence it seems rather natural to call \AF{semantics}
``the fundamental lemma of semantics''. We prove it in a module parametrised
by a \AF{Semantics}, which would correspond to using a Section in Coq.
It is defined by structural recursion on the term. Each constructor is
replaced by its semantic counterpart
which combines the induction hypotheses for its subterms.

\begin{figure}[h]
\ExecuteMetaData[type-scope-semantics.agda/Semantics/Specification.tex]{fundamental}
\caption{Fundamental Lemma of \AR{Semantics}\label{fig:fundsem}}
\end{figure}

\section{Syntax Is the Identity Semantics}
\label{sec:syntactic}

As we have explained earlier, this work has been directly influenced by
McBride's ~(\citeyear{mcbride2005type}) manuscript. It seems appropriate
to start our exploration of \AR{Semantics} with the two operations he
implements as a single traversal. We call these operations syntactic
because the computations in the model are actual terms and almost all term
constructors are kept as their own semantic counterpart. As observed by
McBride, it is enough to provide three operations describing the properties
of the values in the environment to get a full-blown \AR{Semantics}. This
fact is witnessed by our simple \AR{Syntactic} record type together with
the fundamental \AF{lemma} of \AR{Syntactic}, a function turning its
inhabitants into associated \AR{Semantics}.

\begin{figure}[h]
\ExecuteMetaData[type-scope-semantics.agda/Semantics/Syntactic/Specification.tex]{syntactic}
\ExecuteMetaData[type-scope-semantics.agda/Semantics/Syntactic/Specification.tex]{syntacticsem}
\caption{Every \AR{Syntactic} gives rise to a \AR{Semantics}\label{fig:syntactic}}
\end{figure}

The shape of \ARF{lam} or \ARF{one} should not trick the reader
into thinking that this definition performs some sort of η-expansion:
the fundamental \AF{lemma} indeed only ever uses one of these when the
evaluated term's head constructor is already respectively a \AIC{`lam}
or a \AIC{`one}. It is therefore absolutely possible to define renaming
or substitution using this approach. We can now port McBride's definitions
to our framework.


\subsection{Functoriality, also known as Renaming}

Our first example of a \AR{Syntactic} operation works with variables as
environment values. We have already defined thinning earlier (see
\cref{sec:categoryrenamings}) and we can turn a variable into a term by using
the \AIC{`var} constructor. The type of \AF{sem} specialised to this
semantics is then precisely the proof that terms are thinnable.

\end{minipage}
\caption{Thinning as a \AR{Syntactic} Instance\label{fig:synren}}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Simultaneous Substitution}

Our second example of a semantics is another spin on the syntactic model:
environment values are now terms. We get thinning for terms from the
previous example. Again, specialising the type of \AF{sem}
reveals that it delivers precisely the simultaneous substitution.

\end{figure}

\section{Printing with Names}
\label{prettyprint}

Before considering the various model constructions involved in defining
normalisation functions deciding different equational theories, let us
make a detour to a perhaps slightly more surprising example of a
\AF{Semantics}: printing with names. A user-facing project would naturally
avoid directly building a \AD{String} and rather construct an inhabitant of
a more sophisticated datatype in order to generate a prettier output
(\cite{hughes1995design,wadler2003prettier,Bernardy:2017:PBG:3136534.3110250}).
But we stick to the simpler setup as \emph{pretty} printing is not our
focus here.

This example is interesting for two reasons. Firstly, the distinction between
values and computations is once more instrumental: we get to give the procedure
a precise type guiding our implementation. The environment carries \emph{names}
for the variables currently in scope while the computations thread a name-supply
to be used to generate fresh names for bound variables. If the values in the
environment had to be computations too, we would not root out some faulty
implementations e.g a program picking a new name each time a variable is mentioned.
%
Secondly, the fact that the model's computation type is a monad and that this
poses no problem whatsoever in this framework means it is appropriate for
handling languages with effects (\cite{moggi1991notions}), or effectful
semantics e.g. logging the various function calls. Here is the full definition
of the printer.

In the implementation, we define \AF{Name} and \AF{Printer} using a \AR{Wrap}per
with a type and a context as phantom types in order to help Agda's inference
propagate the appropriate constraints. The wrapper \AR{Wrap} does not depend on
the scope \AB{Γ} so it is automatically a \AF{Thinnable} functor, as witnessed by
the (used but not shown) definitions \AF{map\textasciicircum{}Wrap}
(functoriality) and \AF{th\textasciicircum{}Wrap} (thinnability).
%
We also call \AF{Fresh} the State monad threading the name supply which is
essentially a stream of distinct strings.

\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.6\textwidth}
  \ExecuteMetaData[type-scope-semantics.agda/Semantics/Printing.tex]{valprint}

\ExecuteMetaData[type-scope-semantics.agda/Semantics/Printing.tex]{printer}
\end{minipage}
\caption{Names and Printer for the Printing Semantics\label{fig:semprint}}
\end{figure}

We define the printing semantics by collecting intermediate definitions in
a record. For this semantics' notion of values, the scope and type indices
are phantom types. As a consequence thinning for \AF{Name}s (the field
\ARF{th\textasciicircum{}𝓥}) is trivial: we reuse \AF{th\textasciicircum{}Wrap},
a function that simply returns the same name with changed phantom indices.
We are now going to look in details at the more interesting cases.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \ExecuteMetaData[type-scope-semantics.agda/Semantics/Printing.tex]{semprint}
  \caption{Printing as a semantics}
\end{figure}

%
The variable case (\ARF{var}) is a bit more interesting: after looking up a
variable's \AF{Name} in the environment, we use \AF{return} to produce the
trivial \AF{Printer} constantly returning that name.

\ExecuteMetaData[type-scope-semantics.agda/Semantics/Printing.tex]{printvar}

As often, the case for λ-abstraction (\ARF{lam}) is the most interesting one.
We first use \AF{fresh} to generate a \AF{Name}, \AB{x}, for the newly-bound
variable, then run the printer for the body, \AB{mb}, in the environment
extended with that fresh name and finally build a string combining the name
and the body together.

\ExecuteMetaData[type-scope-semantics.agda/Semantics/Printing.tex]{printlam}

We then have a collection of base cases for the data constructors of type
\AIC{`Unit} and \AIC{`Bool}. These give rise to constant printers.

\ExecuteMetaData[type-scope-semantics.agda/Semantics/Printing.tex]{printcons}

Finally we have purely structural cases: we run the printers for each of~
the subparts and put the results together, throwing in some extra parenthesis~
to guarantee that the result is unambiguous.

The fundamental \AF{lemma} of \AR{Semantics} will deliver a printer which needs to be run
on a \AD{Stream} of distinct \AD{String}s. Our definition of \AF{names} (not
shown here) simply cycles through the letters of the alphabet and guarantees
uniqueness by appending a natural number incremented each time we are back at
the beginning of the cycle. This crude name generation strategy would naturally
be replaced with a more sophisticated one in a user-facing language: we could
e.g. use naming hints for user-introduced binders and type-based schemes otherwise
($f$ or $g$ for functions, $i$ or $j$ for integers, etc.).

In order to kickstart the evaluation, we still need to provide \AR{Name}s for each
one of the free variables in scope. We will see in \cref{section:genericprinting}
how to build an initial environment to print open terms using more advanced tools.
Here we are satisfied with a simple \AF{print} function for closed terms.

We can observe \AF{print}'s behaviour by writing a test; we state it as a
propositional equality and prove it using \AIC{refl}, forcing the typechecker
to check that both expressions indeed compute to the same normal form. Here
we display the identity function.
