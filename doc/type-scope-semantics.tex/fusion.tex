\chapter{Fusions of Evaluations}

When studying the meta-theory of a calculus, one systematically
needs to prove fusion lemmas for various semantics. For instance,
Benton et al.~(\citeyear{benton2012strongly}) prove six such lemmas
relating renaming, substitution and a typeful semantics embedding
their calculus into Coq. This observation naturally led us to
defining a fusion framework describing how to relate three semantics:
the pair we sequence and their sequential composition. The fundamental
lemma we prove can then be instantiated six times
to derive the corresponding corollaries.
