After having implemented numerous semantics in \cref{type-scope-semantics},
we have gained an important insight: the structure of the constraints telling
us how to define a \AR{Sem} is tightly coupled to the definition of the
language. So much so that we should in fact be able to \emph{derive} them
from the definition of the language.
